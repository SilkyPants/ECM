==ECM - Yet another EVE Character Monitor
==

GTK# based character monitor for EVE Online.

Basically my version of something similar to EveMon - but that runs on the Mono API for cross platform goodness. 

I have a lot of ideas that I would like to get into here, but it all comes down to time since that is something I cannot control ;)

So far the immediate plans are to have:

Ability to add/remove API keys (new cusomizable versions)
Skill planner that reschedules around conflicts
Map View/Journey planner
